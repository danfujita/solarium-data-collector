Solarium Data Collector is an Apache-licensed Golang version of data collection backend microservice, which is currently under development by Apsis Science & Technology LLC. 

The goal of this application is to collect data from Solarium devices, and to upload the telemetry data to InfluxDB and the payload data to S3. 
The application works with a separate customer facing web portal service, which is currently under development. 

The Python hardware code for Solarium can be found at https://github.com/apsistech/Solarium
